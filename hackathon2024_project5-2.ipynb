Your daddy's on the floor. How old are you? I'm five years old and I have a dog in the house. Okay, there, there, okay. Let me get something right over to you. Did you go in your mommy and daddy's room? Oh, and there's a blood. Oh, over the place? Not all over. There's blood on the plant and blood on the floor. Oh, my goodness. You have your little doggy with you? And three cats. Well, get some cats too. Three cats and one dog. Okay. Are you the only one there? Is this like mommy and daddy? Oh, my... It's dad and mommy and daddy and they didn't even answer. Okay. Okay, what I want you to do, honey, I want you to stand up for me. What is your name? Oh, that's a very pretty name. Okay. Oh, I'm so sorry. That is a beautiful name. What's your doggy's name? Liza. Okay. And what makes you wake up tonight? Okay. And what makes you wake up tonight? There was... I think I had a gun shot. You heard a gun? Yes, I see a bullet laying on it. Well, I think it's a bullet. Really? Do you? Who has a gun in the house? I don't see a gun, but scared. Oh, sweetheart, I will not let anything happen to you. Can you send me a message? I promise I will. You're only five years old. You are so smart for five years old. Wow! Are you off of school this week? No, I go to school next year. Oh, my gosh, you're not even in kindergarten yet? No. Oh, what's your doggy's name? Liza.\""
